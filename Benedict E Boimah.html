<h1>Journey of Education</h1>
<p>
  when I begin my educational journey in 1997, at the St.Paul Catholic School in Zeansue town, Yellequelleh District in Bong County, things was really tough with me most especially a single parent where the only source of survivability is farming. At the Elementary Division, things wasn't that much harder up to some level of my Junior Secondary School.

 <p> At some level of my Junior Secondary School, things begin to go in the opposite direction as support toward my schooling begin critically hard due to my mum inability to adequately cater for my financial needs. As a result of the that, I was compelled to dropped out of school to help my mother do farming activities to cater to the needs of the family as I was the only surviving son of my mother with no help coming in from any external family members.

   With the help of God, I was able to complete my Senior Secondary School in Totota City, Lower Bong County from the Ernest Jerome Yancy High School.
